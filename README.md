"Start the day with a general overview of the week: supervised versus unsupervised learning
Decision trees (mostly theory)

- Introduction of trees. Why are they useful?
- Classification trees: example
- Choosing the perfect split: calculate the gain using either entropy or gini
- Pruning a tree
- Regression trees: what is different
- prediction using a tree and misclassification error/confusing matrices"
